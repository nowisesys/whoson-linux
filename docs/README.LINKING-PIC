   README ON RECOMPILING GSOAP WITH PIC INFORMATION


If linking shared library against libgsoap* bails out with relocation 
errors, then the gSOAP libraries were probably not compiled with PIC 
information. 

1. Recompile with PIC information:

     bash> cd gsoap-x.y
     bash> CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -DPIC -Wall -O2" ./configure
     bash> make
     bash> sudo make install

2. See README.SHARED-LIBS for information on building gSOAP using
   GNU libtool.

3. Gentoo Linux specific:

   If using Gentoo Linux, then find your CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS in /etc/make.conf
   and pass them to emerge:
   
     bash> CXXFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=k8 -msse3 -fPIC -DPIC" \
           CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=k8 -msse3 -fPIC -DPIC" \
	   emerge net-libs/gsoap
