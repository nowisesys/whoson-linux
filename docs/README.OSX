  NOTES FOR MAC OS X


** GENERAL:

   The library and all applications should compile clean using GCC (g++) 4.2.1 
   on Mac OS X (Lion). The examples fails to build due to -rpath being added to
   the linker flags. 

   Binary releases of whoson for Mac OS X can be downloaded from:
   https://nowise.se/oss/whoson/linux/download
   
** REQUIREMENTS:

   The GNU toolchain in Mac OS X is ofter out of date. You might have to update 
   its components (libtool, automake, ...) before building the source code. 
   
   See https://nowise.se/oss/whoson/linux/macosx for instructions
   on updating the GNU toolchain.

   Continue by installing gSOAP to /usr/local (default). The source code can 
   be downloaded from Download from http://gsoap2.sourceforge.net/

** INSTALL:

   Make sure to exclude examples from being built. Configure and install using:

     bash> ./configure --disable-examples
     bash> make
     bash> sudo make install

** SETUP:

   This section describes the steps to integrate whoson with the system to
   enable automatic registration of logon/logoff events. The whoson program
   can be used without these additional steps.

   o) Files:
   
      Copy utility scripts to /usr/local/bin and configuration files to /etc:

        bash# cd admin
        bash# cp whosonp /usr/local/bin
        bash# cp rc.local.shutdown whoson.conf /etc

   o) Logon/Logoff events:
   
      The whosonp script is a script intended to be runned from hooks into
      the loginwindow module. It detects whether to register logon or logoff
      events based on how its was invoked (thru the symbolic link name).

      Create symbolic links to whosonp in /usr/local/bin:

        bash# cd /usr/local/bin
        bash# ln -s whosonp whoson.login
	bash# ln -s whosonp whoson.logout
	
      Register whoson.login and whoson.logout as script hooks into the logonwindow 
      domain (module). Notice that write might overwrite any previous content. Make
      sure to use the fully qualified module name, or the hooks won't work:

        bash# defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook \
              /usr/local/bin/whoson.login
        bash# defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook \
              /usr/local/bin/whoson.logout

      Review the hooks:

        bash# defaults read com.apple.loginwindow

   o) Shutdown/Reboot
   
      Closing all active logon sessions are handled by the rc.local.shutdown 
      script. Just copy it to /etc.

   See https://nowise.se/oss/whoson/linux/setup for latest setup 
   information.
