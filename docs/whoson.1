.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whoson
[\fIoptions\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
WhosOn is an distributed system for keeping track of computer logon/logoffs by 
users. The main reason behind this system is saving accounting information at
one point for further accounting processing. 

The system is cross-plattform, currently supporting Linux, Windows and Mac OS X,
but porting to other platforms is expected to require minimal efforts. 

The whoson application itself provides an web service client using the C++ 
libwhoson library. The communication with the server application is using SOAP,
optional requiring HTTP basic authentication if enabled on the server side.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-i\fR,\-\-logon:
Store logon event. This option should be used when the logon session begins.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR,\-\-logout:
Store logoff event. This option should be used when the logon session ends.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR,\-\-list:
List logon events (see filter and matching).
.TP
\fB\-F\fR,\-\-close:
Close matching sessions. This option is intended to be used together
with the \-l (list) option. Once the logon event to close has been
filtered out, simply append \-F to close all of them at once.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR,\-\-help:
Show this help.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR,\-\-version:
Get version info.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR,\-\-verbose:
Be more verbose.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR,\-\-debug:
Enable debug mode.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR,\-\-session:
Use session mode (login on start/logout on exit). Using this option causes the
application to record an logon event (see -i) and wait for the parent process to
exit. Once the parent process has exited, an logoff event is recorded and this 
application exits.

This option is typical used if whoson is started from a shell startup script
as a result of an user loging on.
